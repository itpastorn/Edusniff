A coding standard for phpCodeSniffer suitable for use in teaching environments (webed directory)
Mostly based on the Zend standard, but relaxed and all rules specific to the Zend project have been removed

In addition to this, I also keep the coding Standard Keryx here, to be used in my own projects

Finally I will also put a few PHP-scripts here that are being used for educational purposes

This started as a work for The Web Standards Project Education Task Force InterACT curriculum project
http://interact.webstandards.org/

Specifically the course in Server Side Scripting
http://interact.webstandards.org/curriculum/serve-side-dev/server-side-scripting-1/?overview

That project will in turn be used by the W3C and its Education Community Group
